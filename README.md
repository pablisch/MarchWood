# MarchWood

I made this webpage but I also made the wood it displays! ðŸ’š
 
This is simple one page website displaying a street view 360 degrees image of March Wood, Tottenaham, London, UK. It was made more for the practical purpose of using it as a resource than for any coding value although getting the streetview to behave as I wanted it to defintely had its challenges.

March Wood is a small woodland and Forest School site in Tottenham, London, UK.
I was tasked with introducing Forest School to the school which at the time had no woodland at all, just open playing fields.
I personally planted almost all of the thousands of trees there and managed the woodland in its early years while also running Forest School sessions there.

This web page is currently deployed at [https://pablisch.github.io/MarchWood/](https://pablisch.github.io/MarchWood/).
